# kubernetes-vpa-inplace
This project leverages Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) with in-place resource updates to dynamically adjust CPU and memory allocations for running pods without restarting them. It minimizes application downtime and improves resource efficiency, making it ideal for workloads with fluctuating resource demands.
